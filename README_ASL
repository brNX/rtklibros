rtklib version 2.4.1

================== GPS MEASUREMENT NODE ========================

To start the "rover" gps measurements launch the start_gps_meas file. 
This will start a service reading from COM and publishing data to TCP port 8600.

===> adapt parameters such as serial port config in the launchfile


================ KINEMATIC PROCESSING SERVER ===================

To start the "real time kinematic processing" server launch start_rtkrcv.

===> you probably want to adjust the settings in ./conf/rtk_server.conf

IMPORTANT VALUE CHANGES: (flagged with @ADAPT in the config file)

line 60: ant1-pos1  (deg|m) = LAT STATION1 POSITION
line 60: ant1-pos2  (deg|m)  = LON STATION1 POSITION
line 60: ant1-pos3  (m|m) = HEIGHT STATION1 POSITION	

line 68: ant2-pos1  (deg|m) = LAT STATION2 POSITION
line 69: ant2-pos2  (deg|m)  = LON STATION2 POSITION
line 70: ant2-pos3  (m|m) = HEIGHT STATION2 POSITION	

line 89: inpstr1-type = ROVER MEAS SOURCE
line 90: inpstr2-type = BASE MEAS SOURCE
line 97: inpstr1-path = ROVER MEAS SOURCE PARAM
line 98: inpstr2-path = BASE MEAS SOURCE PARAM


This will start a service reading both station and rover measurements, computing
the solution (baseline ENU) and publishing it at port 8601 and as a ros message at topic:
/baseline
